# Project Overview

This project is a guided tutorial from https://www.edureka.co/blog/library-management-system-project-in-java focused on developing a Java-based library management system. It uses Java, JDBC, JFrame, and MySQL. I did this project for learning purposes and to gain exposure to these technologies.
